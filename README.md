This project is a password-based locking prototype. The Locker/box is provided with a password which can be changed by the user according to his/her convenience. The relevant messages are displayed on the LCD screen, guiding the user. Once the Arduino is reset, if the user enters the correct password, the servo motor helps in unlocking the locker. If the user enters the incorrect password, the LED blinks thrice and a message denoting incorrect password is displayed on the serial monitor and the buzzer buzzes.
